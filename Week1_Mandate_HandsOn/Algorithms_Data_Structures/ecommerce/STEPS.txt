Step 1: Understand Asymptotic Notation
Big O Notation is used to describe the performance (time or space) of an algorithm as the input size grows.

Linear Search:

Best case: O(1) – target is the first element

Average case: O(n)

Worst case: O(n) – target is the last or not present

Binary Search:

Best case: O(1) – target is the middle element

Average/Worst case: O(log n) – array must be sorted


Step 2: Product Class


Step 3: Search Implementation


Step 4: Analysis
Linear Search: Simpler, does not require sorting, but slower (O(n))

Binary Search: Faster (O(log n)) but requires sorted data

Recommendation: Use Binary Search if data is static or sorted; otherwise, use Linear Search for small or unsorted datasets.
