Step 1: Understand Recursive Algorithms
Recursion is a technique where a method calls itself. It’s useful for solving problems where a solution depends on solutions to smaller subproblems.


Step 2 & 3: Recursive Growth Calculation.


Step 4: Analysis
Time Complexity (Recursive): O(n) – One call per year

Space Complexity (Recursive): O(n) – Due to call stack

Optimization: Use iteration or memoization to avoid stack overflow and redundant calculations.
